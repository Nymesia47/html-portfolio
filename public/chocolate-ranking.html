<h3>Kinder Cereal</h3>

<p>Kinder Cereals is a snack with a unique taste that combines the deliciousness of Kinder chocolate with the simplicity of cereals. A tasty chocolate bar that encloses, in a soft milk filling, the crunchiness of 5 cereals (barley, rice, wheat, spelt and buckwheat) simply puffed and toasted, to be savored in every bite.</p>
<h3>Raffaello</h3>

<p>Raffaello is a spherical coconutâ€“almond truffle made by the Italian manufacturer Ferrero. Made of coconut from the Pacific Islands and white almonds from California. Raffaello is pure pleasure, <i>piacere puro.</i></p>
<h3>Milka Milk Chocolate with Hazelnuts bar</h3>

<p>It's very sweet, creamy and flavorful! This hazelnut milka bar is delicious. The hazel nuts add a really nice crunch and chew to the milk chocolate</p>
